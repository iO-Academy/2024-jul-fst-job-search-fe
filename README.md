Job Listing Frontend Website

For this project we have been tasked with creating the front end of a website
that uses an API to provide our information.

To build this front end we are using React as a library to demonstrate knowledge of component,
useState, useEffect and lifting state, and we have been using Vite as a compiler.

To style the website we have used Bootstrap as a framework.

This is a team exercise, and we are working in a scrum, and we are working in an AGILE way.
